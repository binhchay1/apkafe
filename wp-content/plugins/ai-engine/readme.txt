== Beyond the Features ==

AI Engine offers its own internal API (including a REST API). This allows you to integrate AI capabilities into your WordPress website, no-coding solutions, and more. It has been officially integrated with many plugins to enhance their functionality. Here are a few examples:

* [Media File Renamer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/media-file-renamer/)
* [SEO Engine](https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-engine/)
* [Social Engine](https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-engine/)
* [Snippet Vault](https://wordpress.org/plugins/snippet-vault/)

== My Dream for AI ==

I am thrilled about the endless opportunities that AI brings. But, at the same time, I can't help but hope for a world where AI is used for good, and not just to dominate the web with generated content. My dream is to see AI being utilized to enhance our productivity, empower new voices to be heard (because let's be real, not everyone is a native speaker or may have challenges when it comes to writing), and help us save time on tedious tasks so we can spend more precious moments with our loved ones and the world around us.

I will always advocate this, and I hope you do too ðŸ’•
