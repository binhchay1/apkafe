== Description ==

WordPress will let you install a NEW plugin or theme from a zip file, but it does NOT allow you to upgrade them from a zip file. If you try to upgrade from a zip file, you will get an error message that says "destination already exists" and the upgrade will fail. WordPress will not allow you to upgrade from a zip file.

Update Theme and Plugins from Zip File will allow you to easily upgrade from a zip file, avoiding the "destination already exists" error message.
